# Welcome to the Python Data Structures Tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to our Python Data Structures Tutorial! In this tutorial, we will explore three fundamental data structures: Queue, Set, and Tree.
Understanding these data structures is crucial for anyone looking to build efficient and scalable software applications.

## What Will You Learn?

- **Queues**: Learn how queues work, their properties, and how to implement them in Python.
- **Sets**: Explore the concept of sets, their unique features, and how to leverage them in Python for various operations.
- **Trees**: Dive into the world of trees, understand their structure, different types, and practical implementations.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming language syntax. Familiarity with fundamental
programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions will be beneficial.
