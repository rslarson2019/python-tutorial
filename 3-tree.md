# Introduction to Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes. Each node contains a value and a list of references to its child nodes. The topmost
node is called the root node, and each node in the tree is connected by edges.

## Why Use Trees?
Trees are widely used in computer science due to their efficient structure for organizing data. They provide fast searching, insertion, and
deletion operations. Trees are used in various applications such as representing hierarchical data (like file systems), organizing data for
searching (like binary search trees), and in implementing data structures like heaps and priority queues.

## Big O Notation

The tree data structure enhances code efficiency in several ways:

**Fast Search**: Trees, such as binary search trees (BSTs), provide efficient search operations. BSTs offer average-case time complexity of O(log
n) for search, insertion, and deletion, making them suitable for applications requiring fast retrieval of data.

**Ordered Storage**: Some tree structures, like balanced binary search trees or B-trees, maintain elements in sorted order. This facilitates
range queries, nearest neighbor searches, and other operations requiring ordered data.

**Hierarchical Organization**: Trees naturally represent hierarchical relationships among data elements. This is beneficial for tasks like file
system organization, representing organizational structures, or managing hierarchical data in databases.

**Balanced Structure**: Balanced trees, such as AVL trees or Red-Black trees, ensure that the height of the tree remains relatively low. This
leads to more predictable performance and prevents worst-case scenarios, ensuring efficient operations.

**Efficient Modification**: Trees support efficient insertion and deletion operations while maintaining their structural properties. This allows
for dynamic updates to the data structure without sacrificing performance.

**Tree Traversal**: Trees provide efficient traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order) that allow developers to process all elements
in a structured manner. These traversal algorithms are essential for various tree-based applications, such as expression evaluation or sorting.

### Example Problem: Binary Tree Traversal
Let's start with implementing a binary tree traversal algorithm in Python. We'll define a basic binary tree structure and implement three
different types of traversal: in-order, pre-order, and post-order.

### Additional Example Problem: Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation
Now, let's implement a binary search tree (BST) in Python and write a function to search for a value in the BST.

### Real World Example Problem:
Now, your task is to implement a function delete(self, value) in the BinarySearchTree class to delete a node with the given value from the BST.
You can choose any method for deletion (e.g., replacing with the minimum value of the right subtree, or the maximum value of the left subtree).
Test your implementation with various cases to ensure correctness.
